# Patchwork :3

Patchwork is a lil modpack, with some mods I belive to be underrated/underappreciated (and some more popular ones). I originally made it to just play with some friends (*hi, friends*) but it ended up becoming it's own little pack!

While Patchwork is technically kitchen-sink, I've worked to eliminate any bloat. If you want a feature, one of the mods probably has it. You might have to work for it though...

It is relatively small, with a total of 90 mods. Performance was on the top of the list; any mod with a substantial performance impact has been removed.

I've tried to make as many things automatable as possible, though not through traditional, 'magic box' ways. You'll have to think creatively, and use redstone and non-conventional logistics.

I haven't written a questbook or guide for any of the mods, mostly because the in-game guidebooks for said mods are quite expansive and do a good job on their own. The only exception is Yttr, which has no in-game guide, so here's a [link to it's wiki.](https://yttr.y2k.diy/)

Major content mods include Applied Energistics 2, Botania, NEEPMeat and Spectrum. Of course, there are also plenty of smaller mods and addons to fill in the gaps.

### Notes

Alot of some mods' automation is based not on on-demand with AE2, but with passive processes. Almost everything is automatable if you try hard enough, and having passive systems is encouraged.

While Waystones is in the pack, I wanted to balance it somehow, because Yttr's fast travel is so unique and I don't want to make it obsolete. So, I've removed everything but Warp Plates. You can set up a plate in your base and one in the mines and teleport between them, but to have a network of travel points, you can use Yttr.

I have gated AE2, but Tom's Simple Storage is an option for before that.

### Contact

If you find a bug, dislike balancing in some aspect, want a mod added/removed, have an idea to make an item automatable, or hate a feature of a mod that's necessary for some reason, *please* make a new issue.
